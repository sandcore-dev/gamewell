# Gamewell

Gamewell is a game logging application.

## Usage

Gamewell was developed for private usage only, so there is no registration form available.
You can add one yourself if you fork the repository, or create a user through Tinker.

Using the application is pretty straightforward. Under "Games" you can add a game. You can edit,
but not delete, a game. The link for the update form is a bit hidden: the game name itself is a link.

Next, you have to add a level, like "easy" or "hard", but this can actually be anything,
and can be left empty. Editing happens the same way as with games: through the somewhat hidden link.

Finally (but is it really?) you can add a status to a level. This may seem a little misleading or
counterintuitive, as at first you have to enter an attempt number. But on the edit screen,
you can change the status of the attempt. If you finished the game at the level you specified,
you can set it to 'finished'. But maybe you don't like the game, so you set it to 'dropped'.

The status 'ongoing' is obviously for when you're playing the game and want to record the time spent.
This is called an 'activity' and in the attempt (or status) screen, it will list all
periods you have played the game. Starting and stopping an activity happens with the green Start
and red Stop links.

That's it! Enjoy your game together with Gamewell!
